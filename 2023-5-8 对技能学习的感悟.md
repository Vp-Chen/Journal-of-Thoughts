|对技能学习的感悟|2023-5-8|日志|学习|

这几个月以来，发现学习一项技能其实所需的时间比自己想的要短不少，通常入门一项技能只需要1个月左右的时间，而成为中级用户则只需要4-6个月时间，
对于大多数人来说这一水平已经足够了。

这个过程中习得的技能会显著改变你的思维方式和解决问题的手段。
因此，若要制定长期计划，最佳时长应为4-6个月之间，短于4个月则过于冒进，太长则会使计划失去意义。

另外，这段时间的摆烂使我认识到一件事，短期突破需要靠**压力**，但长期的进步非常非常需要一个合理**目标**。
制定目标，最重要的是合理，过高的目标会带来大量压力，反而会降低积极性，即便最后达成了也会导致报复性的摆烂。

### 如何制定合理的目标？(以下来自Chatgpt）

> Setting long-term goals is an important aspect of personal and professional development. Long-term goals provide direction and purpose, and they can help you stay focused and motivated over time. Here are some steps to help you create suitable long-term goals:

>1.Reflect on Your Values and Vision: Start by considering your values, passions, and vision for the future. What do you care about most? What kind of person do you want to become? What kind of life do you want to lead? Reflecting on these questions can help you identify the areas in which you want to set long-term goals.

>2.Define Specific Goals: Once you have a sense of your values and vision, define specific long-term goals that align with them. Long-term goals are typically set for a period of several years or more. Be clear and specific about what you want to achieve. For example, instead of setting a vague goal like "become successful," set a specific goal like "become a manager in my company within the next five years."

>3.Make Your Goals SMART: Use the SMART criteria to ensure that your goals are well-defined and achievable. SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Each goal should have clear criteria for success, a way to measure progress, a realistic chance of being achieved, relevance to your values and vision, and a specific time frame for completion.

>4.Break Down Your Goals: Break down your long-term goals into smaller, more manageable short-term goals or milestones. This will make it easier to track your progress and stay motivated. For example, if your long-term goal is to run a marathon in two years, you might set short-term goals to run a 5K in six months, a 10K in one year, and a half-marathon in 18 months.

>5.Create an Action Plan: Develop a detailed action plan that outlines the steps you need to take to achieve each of your long-term goals. Include specific tasks, deadlines, and resources you will need. An action plan will help you stay organized and focused on the tasks that will move you closer to your goals.

>6.Monitor Your Progress: Regularly review and assess your progress toward your long-term goals. Are you on track to meet your milestones? Are there any obstacles or challenges that you need to address? Make adjustments to your action plan as needed to ensure that you stay on track.

>7.Stay Flexible and Adaptable: Keep in mind that circumstances can change, and you may need to adjust your goals over time. Be open to reevaluating and revising your goals as needed. It's okay to change your goals if they no longer align with your values, priorities, or life circumstances.

>8.Stay Motivated: Stay motivated by celebrating your achievements, no matter how small. Reward yourself for reaching milestones and making progress toward your long-term goals. Surround yourself with supportive people who encourage and inspire you.

>Remember that setting and achieving long-term goals is a process that requires time, effort, and perseverance. Be patient with yourself, and stay committed to your vision for the future.
